        <h5>
          For the past 23 year, I've been a Structural Drafter/Designer/Special
          Inspector. I wanted a change and switching to a Full Stack Developer
          fits and feels right!
          <br></br>As a Full Stack Developer, I want to continue to build a
          better tomorrow. I also enjoy building custom PC's, Servers, and have
          a little networking knowledge too.
          <br></br>

          recently learned
