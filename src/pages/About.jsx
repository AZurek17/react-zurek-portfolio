        <h1>Here is a little bit about me </h1>
        <h5>For the past 23 year, I've been a Structural Drafter/Designer/Special Inspector. 
                    I wanted a change and switching to be Full Stack Developer fits and feels right! As a Full Stack Developer, I want to continue to build a better tomorrow. 
                    I also enjoy building custom PC's, Servers, and have a little networking knowledge too. 
                    Below is a summary of my Developer skills I've recently learned
